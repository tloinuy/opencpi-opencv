This version of OpenCPI is the initial Open Source version, after breaking up its commercial software/firmware antecedent, removing any parts that had any OSS-incompatible encumbrances, reimplementing new parts for a widely available platform, and putting it back together for this initial OSS release.  We have a significant TODO list that includes both "finishing" the job of deconstructing and reconstructing it cleanly, better integrating the older and newer parts, improving the development processes, and applying more consistent style, naming and coding conventions.  Early adopters and evaluators should understand the prototype nature of this release, which is based on a mix of mature code and very new code.  We expect rapid evolution and maturity due to projects currently underway that will use this technology.

In general the code is divided up between:

Core - the core software used in all cases, including the component model support different component authoring models (CP289 RCC/FPGA, CP289DSP, SCA, OpenCL etc.).
Adapt - adaptations for different operating systems, CORBA orbs, control/deployment systems, etc.
FPGA - the core FPGA firmware
tools - tools to support component application development, demonstration, testing etc.

When OpenCPI is used as a substrate to support an SCA-compliant system, it relies on a CORBA ORB, and an SCA Core Framework.
The current version uses OMNIOrb, and the Ossie CoreFramework.  TAO has been used but is not currently up to date.
The current OpenCPI version targets RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.3 on 64 bit x86 systems, although the code has also run on WIndows and Vxworks (in the DKM mode).
The current FPGA support targets a common Xilinx ML555 development board, although little of that code cares about FPGA hardware or vendor.
