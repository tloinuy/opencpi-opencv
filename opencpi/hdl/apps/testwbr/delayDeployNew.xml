<!--

   The concrete deployment of an application assembly on an FPGA: the container layer
   Information to generate CTOP, the container layer
   The tool also takes the reference to the application.
   This container description does not directly reference the application because
   it may be used with any application with the same external signature.
   IO: Connect a data plane connection of the application to an IO port of the ftop
   Interconnect: connect a data plane connection of the application to an interconnect port of the ftop
   (Forget properties now).
   This should be derivable from a global deployment.
   The information we are adding is:
   Foreach external connection:  define IO or Interconnect worker (and props)
   Foreach worker (including io and interconnect) define index.
   Note that the container is ftop dependent, and does not know where the various ftop I/Os really go.

  <!-- Connect the application's external connection named "adc" to the adc
       interface of the adc IO worker taking care to provide any
       adaptation to that exact interface.  This is different from an
       assembly where we simply surface the worker's interface to the
       external surface of the application.  Here we are necessarily
       making a specific adaptation from the application's interface to the IO worker's interface.
       The "name" attribute is the name of the container's interface, which must match what FTOP
       instantiates.
