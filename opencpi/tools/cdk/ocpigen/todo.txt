Maybe allow "value" rather than "DefaultValue".
Allow attributes to be case insensitive.
Modularity for different modules, maybe when we do the OCL model.
Global applications, and deployments.
Share more prop code with runtime.
Maybe the runtime xml should be j-son?
Evolve to use xml schemas.
Better, more consistent error messages, and line numbers, that work with emacs etc.
Perhaps suppress "." in the include path.
Update usage message to be good and correct.
Use gnu getopt/argp or something better, maybe enhance and use the OCPI one etc.
