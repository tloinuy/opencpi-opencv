     * \brief Worker thread for asynchronous job processing.
     *
     * This class implements a worker thread that can be used to schedule
     * asynchronous jobs.  Jobs can be submitted and are processed in a
     * separate thread.  The caller can then poll to see whether the job
     * has completed.
     *
     * Another way to look at it is that this class implements a one-thread
     * thread pool.
     *
     * The worker thread is kept alive even when no job is being run.  This
     * avoids the costs associated with thread creation and destruction.
