       * \brief The abstract base class for all virtual file systems.
       *
       * A file system is a collection of files, which may be readable,
       * writable, or both.  File systems may have a directory hierarchy.
       * File names consist of a number of path components separated by
       * the "/" forward slash character.  File names that start with
       * a forward slash are called absolute file names, otherwise they
       * are called relative file names.  A relative file name is usually
       * relative to a specific directory.  Note that a relative name
       * can still contain more than one path component.
       *
       * Each instance of a file system maintains a "current" directory.
       * If the same VFS instance is shared between multiple threads,
       * names that are relative to the current working directory should
       * be used with care, if other threads might change the file system's
       * working directory concurrently.
       *
       * The root directory of each file system is named "/".  (In the
       * Windows file system-based implementation, the root directory
       * contains sub-directories for all of the local drives, as
       * identified by a drive letter and a colon, e.g., "/C:".)
       *
       * File streams are provided as C++ iostreams.  It is implementation
       * dependent whether streams are seekable.
       *
       * File systems can be identified by a common base URI.  Files and
       * directories within a file system can be identified by an absolute
       * URI.
       *
       * Implementations of this interface may have certain limitations
       * and may not support all features.  Check their manual for details.
       *
       * See also the OCPI::Util::Vfs namespace.
