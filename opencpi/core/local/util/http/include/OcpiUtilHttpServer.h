       * \brief Implementation of the server-side HTTP protocol.
       *
       * This class implements an HTTP 1.1 server connection, i.e., it
       * manages the data exchange with a single client.  This class
       * expects generic std::istream and std::ostream data streams
       * for reading data from and writing data to the client.  The
       * run() operation processes one or more requests from the client,
       * and eventually completes when the connection is closed by
       * the client.  After request processing is complete, the
       * connection can be reset to serve another client.
       *
       * Connection management must be accomplished outside of this
       * class.
       *
       * An instance of type OCPI::Util::Vfs::Vfs is used to read and
       * write files as requested by the client.
