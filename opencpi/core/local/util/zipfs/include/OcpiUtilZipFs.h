       * This class implements the OCPI::Util::Vfs::Vfs file system
       * interface, representing the contents of a Zip file.
       *
       * \note Streams returned by openReadonly() or openWriteonly() are
       * not seekable.  The ZIP file format does not allow for in-place
       * modification, thus open() always fails.
       *
       * \note Only a single file can be open for writing at any time.
       *
       * \note Zip files do not have a directory structure, "directories"
       * are only implied by file names that consist of mulitple path
       * components. Thus, mkdir() and cd() do not have a way of checking
       * that a directory exists, and always succeed.  rmdir() and exists()
       * simply check whether any file has a given prefix.

         *
         * \pre To read from Zip files, the stream that is returned from
         * \a fs->openReadonly (\a name) shall be randomly seekable.
         *
         * \pre To write to Zip files, the stream that is returned from
         * \a fs->open (\a name) shall be randomly seekable, and it shall
         * be possible to modify the directory that contains the Zip file.
         *
         * \post A Zip file is open.
         *
         * \note Setting \a keepOpen to true can significantly reduce I/O
         * when reading or writing multiple files, because the underlying
         * zlib library will re-read the Zip file's table of contents
         * every time the Zip file is re-opened.  However, if \a keepOpen
         * is set to true, an error flushing written data that would
         * normally be result in close() raising an exception, may be
         * delayed until the next file access.  In particular, this may
         * cause closeZip() to raise an exception.
         *
         * \note The ZIP file format by itself does not support
         * file removal.  File deletion is accomplished by copying the
         * contents of the ZIP file, minus the to-be deleted file, to
         * a new temporary file, deleting the original ZIP, and then
         * renaming the temporary file.  So these operations need to
         * be supported by the file system that holds the ZIP file.
         * Writing to an existing file involves deleting that file
         * first.
