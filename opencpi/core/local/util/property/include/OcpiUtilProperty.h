 Definitions for worker metadata encoding,decoding.
 Offline, in tools, this information is encoded into a string format 
 suitable for program level arguments (argv).  All properties are encoded into
 a single string.  This relieves runtime of any parsing overhead (time or space)
 or dependencies on external parsing libraries.

 The "scope" of this property support is configuration properties for CP289
 components.  Thus it is not (yet) intended to support SCA GPP components.

 This file defines the binary (non-string) format of SCA component properties,
 as well as the functions to encode (binary to string) and decode 
 (string to binary).
