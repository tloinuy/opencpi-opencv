/**
 * \mainpage The OCPI::Logger Logging Infrastructure
 *
 * The Logger library provides a logging infrastructure, inspired by the
 * Lightweight Log Service, using the same semantics as the iostream
 * library.
 *
 * Using an abstract base class, actual output may be redirected to a
 * null device, any std::ostream (such as std::cout), a remote logging
 * service, etc.
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Log messages are arbitrary text (unlimited in size), tagged with an
 * integer <em>log level</em>, a <em>producer name</em> and a per-instance
 * <em>producer id</em> string.
 *
 * Loggers are derived from std::ostream, so log messages can be printed
 * using its \<\< operators.
 *
 * The <em>producer id</em> field is intended as a system-wide identifier
 * of the reporting component (process).  The producer id is usually set at
 * startup and remains unchanged.
 *
 * Log messages may optionally be tagged with a <em>producer name</em>,
 * which identifies the subsystem within the component.  If a message
 * is not assigned a producer name, it defaults to the empty string.
 *
 * Logger classes with the <em>Output</em> suffix (e.g.,
 * <em>OStreamOutput</em>) are <em>leaf</em> classes in that they write
 * log messages to some logging destination.  Other classes in this
 * namespace delegate output to secondary loggers.
 *
 * Usually, a single logger instance is instantiated near the beginning
 * of a program, e.g., in main().  Ideally, the type of logger is
 * influenceable by user choice (e.g., via a configuration file).  This
 * instance is then passed, as a polymorphic reference or pointer to the
 * OCPI::Logger::Logger base class, to all functions and classes that
 * produce log messages.  This way, log messages can be printed without
 * being aware of the log message's final destination.
 *
 * \section base The Logger Base Class
 *
 * OCPI::Logger::Logger &mdash; The abstract base class.
 *
 * \section out Output Loggers
 *
 * These classes implement the Logger interface by logging a message to
 * some logging destination.
 *
 * OCPI::Logger::NullOutput &mdash; Send log messages to the "null device".\n
 * OCPI::Logger::OStreamOutput &mdash; Send log messages to any std::ostream.\n
 *
 * \section filters Filters
 *
 * These classes implement the Logger interface by delegating message
 * output to one or more secondary Logger instances.
 *
 * OCPI::Logger::PrefixInserter &mdash; Add a prefix to each log message.\n
 * OCPI::Logger::Tee &mdash; Send log messages to multiple loggers.\n
 * OCPI::Logger::Fallback &mdash; Fall back to another logger if the first one fails.\n
 *
 * \section other Others
 *
 * OCPI::Logger::OStreamAdapter &mdash; Adapt legacy code that logs to an std::ostream.\n
 *
 * \section debug Debug Logger
 *
 * OcpiLoggerDebugLogger.h &mdash; Conditionally log debugging messages.\n
 *
 * Depending on compile-time definition of the the NDEBUG preprocessor
 * symbol, either OCPI::Logger::DebugEnabled::DebugLogger or
 * OCPI::Logger::DebugDisabled::DebugLogger is imported into the
 * OCPI::Logger namespace and becomes OCPI::Logger::DebugLogger.
 * Because doxygen does not interpret the C++ "using" statement,
 * OCPI::Logger::DebugLogger does not show in this documentation.
 * Please refer to the header file OcpiLoggerDebugLogger.h for more
 * information.
 *
 * \section notes Notes
 *
 * This library does not provide a Logger implementation to log to a
 * remote Lightweight Log Service, so that this library does not have
 * a CORBA dependency.

    /**
     * \brief Abstract base class for all loggers.
     *
     * The Logger class is an abstract base class.  Derived classes realize
     * specific output targets for log messages, but are usually passed to
     * functions as a reference or pointer to this base class, so that log
     * messages can be produced without being aware of the actual logging
     * destination.  The Logger class is derived from <em>std::ostream</em>.
     *
     * Given a logger instance, a log message is produced in the following
     * sequence:
     *
     * -# Set the message's <em>log level</em> by emitting (using the \<\<
     *    operator) a OCPI::Logger::LogLevel object or one of the predefined
     *    OCPI::Logger::Level::LwLogLevel enumeration values.
     * -# Optionally, set the <em>producer name</em> by emitting (using the
     *    \<\< operator) a OCPI::Logger::ProducerName object.
     * -# Print the log message contents, using the \<\< operator or any
     *    other applicable std::ostream operation.
     * -# End the log message by flushing the output; this is usually done
     *    by emitting <em>std::flush</em> object using the \<\< operator.
     *
     * Log messages should not be line-oriented and thus
     * should not contain any line breaks.  The logger that eventually prints
     * a message (on the console, in a file, in a dialog box) will take
     * care of breaking long messages across multiple lines, if necessary.
     * In other cases, the tools that are used to view log messages will do
     * the proper formatting.
     *
     * To print a line break despite the above advice, output "\n".
     *
     * Note that <em>std::endl</em> implies writing a newline character
     * followed by a <em>std::flush</em>.  Thus, <em>std::endl</em> also
     * ends a log message, but not before inserting a stray newline
     * character at the end of the message.
     *
     * Derived from <em>std::ostream</em>, Logger instances use the
     * <em>std::ios::rdstate()</em> bitmask to report or propagate errors.
     * In case of an error, the <em>badbit</em> is set, <em>good()</em>
     * returns false, <em>bad()</em> and <em>fail()</em> return true.
     *
     * Logger instances are not seekable.
     *
     * Usually, the only Logger function that is called directly by user
     * code is the setProducerId() function to set the process-wide
     * producer id.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * \code
     *   OCPI::Logger::Logger & logger = ...
     *   logger << OCPI::Logger::Level::ADMINISTRATIVE_EVENT
     *          << OCPI::Logger::ProducerName ("Test")
     *          << "Hello World!"

   * This works around a bug in the WindRiver/Microsoft standard C++
   * library.  (They both seem to be derived from Dinkumware and bear
   * a copyright mark from P.J. Plauger.  The Microsoft VC++ 7.1 one
   * seems to be version "V3.13:0009" while the WindRiver Workbench
   * 2.5 one seems to be version "V4.00:1278".)
   *
   * The issue is the implementation of ostream::flush.  The C++
   * standard says: "If rdbuf() is not a null pointer, calls rdbuf()->
   * pubsync()."
   *
   * The buggy implementation, however, does:
   *
   *   if (!ios_base::fail() && _Myios::rdbuf()->pubsync() == -1)
   *     _State |= ios_base::badbit;     // sync failed
   *
   * The difference being that rdbuf()->pubsync() is not called when
   * ios_base::fail() is true, i.e., when the stream is not good.
   *
   * To ensure thread-safety, some logger implementations acquire a lock
   * during this Logger::setLogLevel() operation, and release it in the
   * streambuf::pubsync() operation.
   *
   * However, if the stream is or becomes "bad" (i.e., failbit is set,
   * e.g., because of an unsuccessful ostream::write() operation), then
   * due to the above logic, streambuf::pubsync() is never called and
   * hence the acquired lock is never released, and all future attempts
   * to write to the stream will deadlock.
   *
   * This would not happen if ostream::flush() was implemented as
   * prescribed by the standard, where calling of streambuf::pubsync()
   * is not preconditioned on the status of the stream.
   *
   * I have not been able to come up with a race condition-free workaround
   * for affected implementations of Logger; my best solution was to clear
   * the failbit here.  Implementations still have to make sure that the
   * failbit is not set while composing a message.
   *
   * Critics may argue that the std::ostream interface is not designed to
   * be thread-safe anyway.
