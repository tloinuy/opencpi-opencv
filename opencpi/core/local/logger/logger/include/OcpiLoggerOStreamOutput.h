     * log messages are written to a <em>std::ostream</em> output stream.
     *
     * A mutex is used to synchronize output if the same OStreamOutput
     * instance is used by multiple threads.  This synchronization does
     * not work if multiple OStreamOutput objects are constructed to
     * reference the same stream, or if the stream is used concurrently
     * with the OStreamOutput object.
