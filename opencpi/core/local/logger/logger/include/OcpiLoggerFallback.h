     * \brief Fallback falls back to another logger, if one fails.
     *
     * The Fallback class implements the Logger interface.  It maintains
     * a list of secondary Logger instances.  When a log message is written,
     * the Fallback class delivers the message to the first delegatee that
     * accepts it.
     *
     * I.e., as long as the primary logger is good (its good() operation
     * returns true), it receives all messages.  If the primary logger is
     * not good, then the Fallback logger tries subsequent logger instances
     * until the log message can be succcessfully written to one of them.
     *
     * The order of precedence is established by the order in which Logger
     * instances are added using the addOutput() operation.
     *
     * The Fallback logger allows to, e.g., set up logging to a remote
     * Logging Service, but to fall back to logging to <em>std::cout</em>
     * when the remote Logging Service fails.
     *
     * Writing the log message succeeds if the message can be delivered
     * to any Logger instance.  Writing the log message fails if the set
     * of Logger instances is empty, or if all Logger instances are in error.
