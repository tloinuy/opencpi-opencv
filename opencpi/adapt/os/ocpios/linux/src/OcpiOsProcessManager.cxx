/*
 * Revision History:
 *
 *     06/04/2009 - Frank Pilhofer
 *                  - Also block SIGINT and SIGTERM in the reaper thread, as
 *                    these should only be delivered to the main thread.
 *                  - Unblock all signals after forking; the new process
 *                    inherits the signal mask.
 *
 *     04/09/2009 - Frank Pilhofer
 *                  - Bugfix: Use pthread_sigmask() instead of sigprocmask().
 *                  - Bugfix: Block SIGCHLD and SIGUSR1 in main thread.
 *                  - Bugfix: Handle multiple children with one SIGCHLD.

/*
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * In order to support both detach() and wait(), we run a single
 * thread to reap our zombie children and to figure out their exit
 * status.
 *
 * We keep a list of all running processes in a global vector, so
 * that the thread can manipulate the data.
 *
 * A mutex and a condition variable is used to signal that a process
 * has terminated, and that wait()ing threads shall reexamine the
 * vector.
 *
 * Pre-2.6 Linux makes life a bit more complicated with a pthreads bug
 * that causes threads to have different process ids.  That bug has the
 * side effect that waitpid() refuses to handle child processes that were
 * started by a different thread -- because the thread that calls
 * waitpid() does not appear to be the child's parent: it's pid does
 * not match the child's getppid() value.
 *
 * Even though Timesys Linux on the VPA-200 reports itself to be based
 * on a Linux 2.6.12.6 kernel, it still suffers from this bug, which has
 * been purged from all other versions of Linux 2.6 that I've seen.
 *
 * The workaround is that child processes must be started from the
 * reaper thread.  So the "started" flag is introduced; if the reaper
 * thread finds an item in the list of children with started==false,
 * it forks and starts the new process.
 *
 * When a ProcessManager wants to start a new process, it appends an
 * item to the list and then wakes up the reaper thread.
