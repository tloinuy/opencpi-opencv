     * \brief Start and manage processes.
     *
     * \note In VxWorks DKM, executables are downloadable kernel modules
     * that export main(), which is run in a new kernel task.  No memory
     * separation exists, "processes" share global symbols with all other
     * instances.  The shutdown() operation requires that the process
     * installs an appropriate handler for the SIGINT signal (the default
     * signal handler does not terminate the task).  The kill() operation
     * deletes the process' main thread, but other threads that were
     * started by that process are not affected, may continue running,
     * and will likely crash as the module is unloaded from memory.
     * Task deletion does not release resources that were held by the
     * task.
     * \note In VxWorks DKM, system defaults are used for the new task's
     * priority, options and stack size.  These system defaults can be
     * configured using the kernel symbols <em>spTaskPriority</em>,
     * <em>spTaskOptions</em> and <em>spTaskStackSize</em>, respectively.
     * Some applications may find the default stack size of 20000 bytes
     * insufficient and may want to redefine the default.
     * \note In VxWorks DKM, the \a executable parameter to the #start()
     * can contain a colon character followed by the name of an entrypoint
     * to be used instead of "main".
