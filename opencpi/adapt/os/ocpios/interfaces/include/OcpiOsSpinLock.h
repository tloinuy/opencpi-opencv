    /**
     * \brief A class for mutual exclusion between threads.
     *
     * Allows for synchronization between different threads within the
     * same process, e.g., to protect access to shared data.  A single
     * instance is shared between the threads that want to synchronize.
     *
     * A spinlock is very similar to a mutex.  However, it is more
     * light-weight, as it does not require a signaling mechanism between
     * the threads, and does not involve the operating system.  Spinlocks
     * are used when the shared resource is likely to be held only briefly
     * by another thread that is running concurrently.  A thread that
     * wants to acquire a spinlock "spins" in a busy-wait loop for the
     * other thread to release its lock.
     *
     * Spinlocks are particularly attractive on SMP and multi-core
     * systems, where the other thread executes concurrently, is not
     * affected by the busy-waiting ("spinning") of the current thread,
     * and is likely to release the shared resource shortly.  In a
     * single-CPU, single-core environment, spinlocks are implemented
     * to yield the current thread's timeslice if the resource is not
     * available, so that the other thread has a chance to run.  Ideally,
     * threads should not be preempted while holding a spinlock.
     *
     * Spinlocks do not guarantee fair scheduling, while mutexes do.  A
     * thread may repeatedly lock the same spinlock without other threads
     * having a chance of aquiring it.  E.g., if a spinlock was used to
     * control access to forks in a "dining philosopher" scenario,
     * starvation might occur.
     *
     * A spinlock may also cause priority inversion, i.e., a lower
     * priority thread preempting a high priority thread from acquiring
     * the lock.
     *
     * A spinlock is useful for protecting very brief accesses to
     * shared data, i.e., when the amount of time that the lock will
     * be held is predictably constant in all circumstances, e.g.,
     * reading or writing a single piece of data.  A mutex should be
     * used if the time is unpredictable, e.g., if it is necessary
     * to call system calls within the critical section.
     *
     * \note On Linux, the spinlock is currently implemented using a mutex.
     * \note On VxWorks, the spinlock is currently implemented using a mutex.
