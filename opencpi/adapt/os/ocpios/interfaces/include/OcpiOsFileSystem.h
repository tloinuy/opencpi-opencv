     * \brief Access to the local file system.
     *
     * These functions abstract from local file name conventions
     * such as the path separator and drive names. The root directory
     * is "/", and '/' is used as the path separator. The toNativeName()
     * and fromNativeName() operations can be used to map a file name
     * between the native and the common format, e.g., for file names
     * that need to be passed to or are received from system calls.
     * Also, user inputs (from the command line, user interaction or
     * configuration files) are usually in native format and must be
     * mapped to the common format for processing.
     *
     * All operations, with the sole exception of fromNativeName(),
     * expect file names in "common" format.
     *
     * This file system abstraction does not consider "." or ".." to
     * be special. They may not be used as path components, except
     * in inputs to the fromNativeName() function.
     *
     * The file system maintains a "current working directory".
     * Relative file names, i.e., names that do not start with '/',
     * are interpreted to the current directory.
     *
     * There is only one file system that is shared by all threads
     * in the process. Multithreaded software needs to be careful
     * when using relative names, if the current working directory
     * may be changed by a different thread.
