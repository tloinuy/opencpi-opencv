********* BACKGROUND *********

This project is part of my M.Eng. thesis at MIT.

The goal of the proposed project is to port a subset of the OpenCV software components to the OpenCPI framework. Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) is a widely used library of over 500 optimized software components for real-time computer vision. The Open Component Portability Infrastructure (OpenCPI) is a real-time embedded (RTE) middleware solution that simplifies programming of heterogeneous processing applications requiring a mix of processing technologies. These include central processing units (CPU), graphics processing units (GPU), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), general-purpose processors (GPP), digital signal processors (DSP), and high-speed switch fabrics. 


********* OVERVIEW ***********

The RCC workers in the library (under /opencpi/components/):
- blur
- canny
- canny_partial
- corner_eigen_vals_vecs
- dilate
- erode
- gaussian_blur
- good_features_to_track
- laplace
- median
- min_eigen_val
- optical_flow_pyr_lk
- scharr
- sobel
- sobel_32f

The demo applications (in their respective folders):
- image_filtering (gradients, smoothing, etc)
- canny (edge detection)
- feature_detection (finds strong corners)
- optical_flow (using the Lucas-Kanade pyramidal method; in progress)
